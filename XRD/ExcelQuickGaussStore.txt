Function ExcelQuickGaussStore(peakwave,s_peakwave, Intensity, DSP)  
// Example ExcelQuickGaussStore(Pt_DSP,Pt_DSP_s,Spodumene_003_Intensity,Spodumene_003_Dsp)

    Wave Intensity, DSP
    Wave peakwave, s_peakwave
       Wave W_coef, W_sigma
       Variable currentsize = numpnts(peakwave)
       InsertPoints currentsize, 1,  peakwave, s_peakwave
       CurveFit /Q gauss Intensity[pcsr(A), pcsr(B)]/X = DSP/D
       peakwave[currentsize] = W_coef[2]
       s_peakwave[currentsize] = W_sigma[2]
       Print W_coef[2], "+/-",W_sigma[2]
 // This function takes values from curve fitting to a guassian and automatically
// puts them into a table along with the errors
 //  The d-space value goes to a _DSP wave and the error goes into a seperate _DSP_s
// wave
 //  Make the _DSP and _DSP_s wave first and append them to a table, after each
// curve fitting the value will added to subsequent points
 //  The cursors need to be at the appropriate points on the graph you are fitting
 //  This function is intended for waves that have been converted from two-theta to
// d-spacing
 //  The function is adaptable for two-theta waves just by substituting _twotheta
// wherever there is dsp in the function
