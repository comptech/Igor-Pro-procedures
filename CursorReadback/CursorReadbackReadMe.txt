CursorReadback folder.sit.hqx	9 Apr 1999Bela FARAGO - ILL - Grenoble <farago@ill.fr>Procedure: CursorReadbackA little utility to read beack data from your graph.It was strongly inspirated by the "Hook Peak Place" demo from WM andsomewhat by the JEG Color Legend of  Jonathan Guyer.So if you include it in your experiment it will add a Hierarchical menu tothe end of the Graph menu with 2 items "Start Cursor Reading" and "StopCursor Reading"As it is in the Graph menu it is enabled only when the 2D graph or andImage is at the front."Start Cursor Reading" will add a line on the top of the Graph andcontinously shows the x,y coordinates of the cursor (changes the cursor toa cross thingy) calculating back the real x and y values from pixels.If the Graph is an Image it shows x,y,zClick on the graph will print x,y(,z) in the history area."Stop Cursor Reading" will remove this control area and return to normaloperation.Side effects:If you enabled it for more than one graph, they all show the same values.(not much a problem as long as we have only one mouse attached to theMac...)Might interfere with J.G-s Jeg Color Legend as it uses the same area to showthe information.I did not try with multiple axis situation or Image+2DPlot+contour as Iwanted to avoid too much calculations in the functions to keep goodresponsiveness.That's all. Feel free to modify it, it is really short.
