Code modification history 

-latest stuff first
********************************************
1.48 November 18, 2010
Added ANL license according to other APS products.
Added FITS as input file format. NOTE: this is special version of the FITS file format (which generic definition is in: R. J. Hanisch et al.: FITS standard, Astronomy & Astrophysics 376, 359Ð380 (2001)). It is likely  going to fail on other files, but it is not clear how this is used in SAXS community at this time. 
Fix for Igor 6.21 new version of TransformAxis1.2.  

1.47 September 1, 2010
updated loader to load mpa/UC files - University of Cincinnati desktop camera.
Fixed problem when selecting Configure GUI fonts without starting other Nika panels. Problem with initialization.
Fixes for Igor 6.20 problems.

1.44 3/3/2010
fixed bug in adding Q scale to images which caused issues when used with InvertImages checkbox. 
Added match strings for same and empty/dark names so one can navigate better through large datasets. Use with * if needed. É not yet in the manual. 

1.43  2/23/2010
Added ability to display CCD image (just the main image) with Qx/Qy or Qy/QZ axes instead of pixels. It is bit cumbersome but should be transparent to users. 
Updated ADSC file reader per request from PReichert@lbl.gov. It is modified to read I0 and other parameters from their file header. 
Changed uncertainity estimates - now can use "old method" (which has bug in formula), Standard Deviation, or Standard error of mean. User choice through GUI (Configuration panel) and added chapter in the manual. 
Added Pilatus loader (again, request from  PReichert@lbl.gov). For now can do tif, float-tiff, img or edf 100k, 1M, and 2M files. Need to test as not all formats were available. Also, currently the headers are loaded and included in wave note, but not used. Compressed tiff files are niot supported. Float-tiff not tested at all. Code added based on matlab code downloaded from somewhere...  
Changed BinaryFileLoader - added option for Low/high byte first for Floats. ESRF edf file is low-byte-first and that could not be read.
Added specialized loader for ESRF edf file, but tested on only one file. Therefore performance is not guaranteed.  

1.42 
Added Solid Angle correction. If selected, data are divided also by solid angle opening (PixelSizeX/SDD * PixelSizeY/SDD). Needs to be used correctly with appropriate Calibration factor. Added to the first tab and to the correction formula. This was requested by someone actually using same detector in different distances. 
Checked and verified Geometrical correction - Divides intensity by cos(2Theta)^3. Took me long time to figure out, but one cos(2theta) is from change in radial pixel size, one is from change in SDD for radial direction and one is from change in SDD for tangential direction. This is correct geometrical correction for change in Solid angle with scattering angle. 
Finished (except for finding all new bugs) the line profile tool - now can do three lines (horizontal, vertical and angle), two GI_SAXS line types (horizontal and vertical, calculates Qx, Qy, Qz) and also ellipse. Can be extended if needed. 
****NOTE: there is a lot of space for optimization if this takes too long to calculate. But it is really spaghetti code by now and needs to be recast with bit more stringent logic before that can be done. ****
Fixed old link in the "About" box to UNICAT web site,which does not exist any more. 
All corrections (geometry correction and polarization correction) are now done to 2D data, so intensity read from Processed image should be fully corrected. 
Another iteration of DND CAT support. Added ability to read data from new log version (1.10) and added corrections for Empty beam data so they should be now scaled properly for subtraction. 

1.41beta
Added (beta) horizontal and vertical line profiles as reduction for GI SAXS support. Needs to be finsihed, but should work by now. 
Enable display of processed (calibrated) image or raw image (NIka was always displaying ONLY raw). Modify the code to store and export the image properly. 
Change of behavior - since user may want to process image only to see processed image, it will now be possible and only warning that nothing is saved (unless user actually does it on his/her own) is printed in history area. 
Fix GUI issue when Monitor I0 appeared even when they were not needed and confused smarter users.  
Change in DND support. Will work bit more on this, but hopefully fixed the mess with transmission and calibration constant.
Fix GetFit2dLocation function on Windows, which seemed not to work in 6.10. I wonder when the change happen?
Changed polarization correction to be available in 2D. 1D is still there... 

1.31
Update for 6.10 - changed way Concatenate is called to avoid error in 6.10 in beam center utilities. 
Added DND CAT support. 


1.30
Fixed file loaders. Missing reference to wave after GBLoadWave caused error. Did Igor Pro change behavior here? It was not necessary in previous versions of Igor?
Added Panels font control tool. Same logic as Irena. 
Removed all panels and windows from Igor menus. 
Added LaB6 as standard with predefined d spacings
Changed display to shows only .img files when ADSC type selected. Supposedly this is the right choice. 

1.20
Added loader for ibw (Igor binary) data. Note: This file contains wave name and it is possible bad things happen if the wave name is conflicting with important wave in Igor experiment. 
Added (and tested) option export of GSAS type data (user request) when two-theta data are produced. 
Added reader for BSL data type. Can read both SAXS and WAXS data images.
Added reader for Fuji image plate reader (BAS2000 and BAS2500). For now only 8 bit data sets is tested, need test data to debug 16 bit data sets. 16 bits should work, if I got it right. 
Finally fixed the Rigaku Raxis file format - may be... Anyway, now it should manage any size Rigaku files and should not fail. Solution from 1.18 was wrong. 

1.19 
Added reader for ASCII matrix with custom load option for .mtx and .prm files from user instrument. Usable for any ASCII matrix, but for this special case will pull out some parameters from the prm file and stuff everything in the wave note, so user can find it there. 

1.18 September 15. 2007
Changed Rigaku loader format - yet another size of images found with different offset. Now I search for the first non-zero byte after the header to find the right offset. Hopefully this will work. 
ADSC loader - added wavelength and energy to be loaded from the header. 
Added loader for WinView (Princeton CCD) .spe file format (using code by Jon Tischler).
Added ability to use Fit2d on Mac as file loader. Download Mac version of Fit2d, install (chmod +x it so it can be run). Due to limitations the temp tiff file will be created in data file area. 

1.17 July 15, 2007
Fixed bug which reset q-binning to logarithmic any time main panel was opened. Should not force users to sensible things this much :-)
Fixed call to open pdf manual to manage when procedures are not in default place. 
Added ADSC loader provided by Alexander Hexemer, Lbnl. Tested with his images.  
Fixed bug in Geom corrections which returned needless error for missing wave. 

1.16 4/11.2007
Previous release broke Igor 5 functionality... This should fix it - there was bug which made it backwards incompatible. 

1.15 3/29/2007   Fix to make compatible with Igor 6.0 
Fixed code for many popup controls, as it was still failing in Igor 6. Should be fixed now. Tested what I could find in Igor 6.01beta11. 
Fixed one bug in Make mask, where the slider ranges were not set correctly on load of new file 
Fixed Bug when wrong extension for flood image was called. The file is always tiff (created by Nika package) but was called with extension of user data.



1.14 2/28/2007
Fixed to make compatible with Igor 6.0 (=== wrong, still were some bugs left)
Modified path to store temp data to system temp directory, so the user can run even when he/she is measly no-permission user, who cannot write in Igor folder. 
Added option to modify imported image by user defined hook function... If this function does not exist, it is not run and all behaves as previously... User can create function which has one parameter (wave) and modifies the same wave. The name has to be as exactly : ModifyImportedImageHook. Example follows:
//******************************************************
function ModifyImportedImageHook(waveToModify)
	wave waveToModify

	string OldDf=GetDataFOlder(1)
	setDataFOlder root:Packages:Convert2Dto1D

	//modify the wave here somehow...
	//this example cuts out of large image only 300 x 300 points...
	Make/O/S/N=(300,300) temp2Dwave		//make new destination wave, 300 x 300 points
	temp2Dwave = waveToModify[920+p][875+q]	//fill this wave with part of image we want to use
	string namWv=nameOfWave(waveToModify)	//find the name of the original wave
	Duplicate/O temp2Dwave, $namWv		//overwrite the original wave with the new one

	//end of user wave modifications... 
	setDataFolder OldDf
end
//******************************************************
This function is run for all imports, except for mask, as that is special created wave. All others will be passed through this function - that includes data import, import of dark and empty and of waves for beam center and mask creation. User needs to make this function inaccessible (rename it), if it should not be run...



1.13 (7/1/2006)
Added separate checkbox for solid angle correction AND polarization correction. Fixed Solid angle correction (it should be 1/cos(angle)^3, matches NIST routines and Fit2D). Placed in routines to be done with 2D data (just after all calibration steps)... Fixed routine NI1A_SolidangleCorrection and added new routine NI1A_GenerateGeometryCorr2DWave. Need to fix the polarization correction routine. That still makes very little sense to me...   
Fixed loader for Rigaku, so it should work on both Max and PCs... Weird, the binary file has Mac-like bit order...

1.12
Requested feature: Added into "Make mask" tool the capability to automatically mask off points with really low intensity. Useful for detectors which have circular active area, so points in corners are set to 0 intensity. 
Added built in loader for Rigaku R-axis data format. The format header contains a lot of principally useful info. Some of it is parsed to the rest of the code (number of points, wavelength, pizel size in mm). All of it is saved in the wave note of the image. Note: Beam center is not parsed, as I am worried that it would overwrite any fitted values user may have. 

1.11
Bug fix - save configuration did not work right (bug introduced in previous versions)... Included at the same time sync for most of popupmenus and listboxes. I wonder what else I am forgetting about. 
Added Ag Behenate second line in known calibrants.

1.10
Tilts reworked and should work now... It is very difficult to verify the proper functionality. Need some real test case with known tilts (and significant)... 
Added fix to fileLoaders to load standard tiff files, which load as 3 layer files (24 bit tiff). Still for B/W images ONLY, dumps the other dimensions... 

1.09
Added option to save image within Igor experiment - can create VERY large files (some images may be 40 Mb large or even more in double precision...)
Added some support (create image, delete saved images, changing the color table and range) for saved images. 
Fixed bug which tripped debugger when nofile existed in selected external image data folder
Added option to skip files witgh no intensity in them. 
Added mpa/asc ascii type of data for Molecular Metrology SAXS system at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville data type. ASCII header, two lineout blocks and the ASCII 2d data. Takes forever to load... 
Start workign on tilts, but these are at this time removed from GUIs

1.08
Added option to process N images at time. It is now possible to select many files and process them in pair,triplets etc...

1.07 
Fixed bug in Q vector creation which resulted in wrong values for wide angle scattering
Fixed bug which resulted n recalcualtion every time of the LUTs.

1.06
Fixed bug which prevented use of mask in beam center tool
Fixed bug in caluclating distances in Beam center tool which caused failure at higher angles.
Added check for existencee of Fit2D program.
Beam center tool - added some new features.
Added check for existence of path when saving config file

1.05 February 16,2005
Fixed geometry correction which in version 1.04 was wrongly implemented... At this time I think it is right...  

1.04 February 15,2005
Added geometry corrections to beam center tool, added manual control for help circle radius.
Hopefully fixed problem with mask in the beam center tool, which caused misbehavior of the tool. 


1.03 February 13 2005
Fixed bug checking if LUT waves need to be recalculated causing recalculation all the time... Rounding error in comparing parameters. 

1.02  February 12 2005
Added beam center and calibrant alignement tools. Still in development...
Added option to have "natural" number of bins - this is equivalent to have linear bins in Q with width of 1 pixel. 

1.01 January 13
Fixed GeneralBinary loader bug, the byte order was fixed at high byte first due to typo in the code.
Added basic beam center tool (fitting of 2D gaussian to attnuated beam). Created GUI where to add rest of the stuff... 


January 6 2005, version 1.0
inital release
